X setup environment:
    X 2D
    X top down
    X camera movement
    X camera zoom

X game menu:
    X restart
    X quit

X player controls:
    X item select

    X item drag
    X item rotation
    X item destruction

        X drag to inventory to destroy


REFINEMENTS:
X delete hot key
X make zoom zoom on mouse hover location
X make camera move on touch to edge of viewport
X clamp camera move to not be able to go farther than the board
X additive selection via additive hotkey
X fix entity->inventory sorting layers to be upon "dragging" state
X give entities a "drag" state, where they've not yet been moved and validation 
    can be performed
X drag and drop to inventory bar should cause a delete
X pending delete selection indicator color
X inventory hotkeys for quick inventory selection and placement
X inventory-hotkey mode should memorize last placement rotation
X inventory-hotkey mode should mass place on cursor while lmb is held
X make entity->cursor follow respect the discrete form of the mouse position
X make escape key function differently per context:
    X deselect if entities are selected
    X exit inventory-hotkey mode
X add telemetry ui for testing
X make screen edge camera move more forgiving
X undo/redo system, buttons, and hotkeys:
    X have HistoryStack keep track of "bottom" so that just like "top", you 
        cannot traverse past it
    X implement redo
    X BUG: rotations do not create history step
    X use own UUIDs for history tracking so that objects can be instantiated and 
        have them reassigned
    X account for dnd onto same positions (should not cause a history step)
X fix game entity management BUGS
X rename entity-hotkey mode to multi-place mode (and other renaming)
X add undo/redo history behavioral descriptions to MANUAL_TESTING doc
X add controls instructions
X refactor selection+drag:
    X decompose functions for setting and applying mouse->entity positional offsets
    X add to reset of offsets to entity group rotation
    X add a global mode for ui-debug (should override local debug settings)
    X add group drag container to the ui-debug mode
X make multi-select rotations rotate entities together instead of individually
- refactor multi-place to use drag-group:
    - make multi-place use a list of prefabs
    - make multi-place ghost entity support multiple entities
    - make multi-place system agnostic to inventory bar selection
    - ensure placement validation is working
    - ensure rotation is working
- refactor player inventory to have single source of truth
    (SOT should be owned by PlayerInventoryManager)
- copy+paste (single and multi):
    - selection of one or more entities is required to use mode
    - copy command should result in multi-placement mode
    - mode causes draggable multi-placement of the initial entities selected
    - the multi-place entities are rotatable
    - lmb-click causes placement
    - lmb held down causes continuous placement
    - placement is committed only if it is valid
    - escape press exits mode
- add inventory selection indicator to inventory bar
- create test scene for testing various entity behaviors:
    - draggable vs. not draggable
    - removable vs. not removable
    - selectable vs. not selectable
    - turnable vs. not turnable
    - automatic behaviors such as movement and rotation


BUGS:


REFACTORS:
- Change entity selection to wrap selected entities in a parent game object. 
    De-selection causes the entities to be de-parented. This may help with doing
    rotations on multiple game objects at the same time.


LATER:
- game play/pause/restart system and controls:
    - play tick system
    - add some entity automated behaviors
    - entity automated behaviors are triggered at every tick
- save system
