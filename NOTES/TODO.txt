X setup environment:
    X 2D
    X top down
    X camera movement
    X camera zoom

X game menu:
    X restart
    X quit

X player controls:
    X item select
    X item placement
    X item drag
    X item rotation
    X item destruction
    X multi-select
    X multi-drag
    X multi-rotation
    X multi-destroy

X UI:
    X inventory:
        X drag from inventory
        X drag to inventory to destroy


REFINEMENTS:
X delete hot key
X make zoom zoom on mouse hover location
X make camera move on touch to edge of viewport
X clamp camera move to not be able to go farther than the board
X additive selection via additive hotkey
X fix entity->inventory sorting layers to be upon "dragging" state
X give entities a "drag" state, where they've not yet been moved and validation 
    can be performed
X drag and drop to inventory bar should cause a delete
X pending delete selection indicator color
X inventory hotkeys for quick inventory selection and placement
X inventory-hotkey mode should memorize last placement rotation
X inventory-hotkey mode should mass place on cursor while lmb is held
X make entity->cursor follow respect the discrete form of the mouse position
X make escape key function differently per context:
    X deselect if entities are selected
    X exit inventory-hotkey mode
X add telemetry ui for testing
X make screen edge camera move more forgiving
X undo/redo system, buttons, and hotkeys:
    X have HistoryStack keep track of "bottom" so that just like "top", you 
        cannot traverse past it
    X implement redo
    X BUG: rotations do not create history step
    X use own UUIDs for history tracking so that objects can be instantiated and 
        have them reassigned
    X account for dnd onto same positions (should not cause a history step)
- fix game entity management BUGS
- make multi-select rotations rotate entities together instead of individually
- copy paste (single and multi)
- create test scene for testing various entity behaviors:
    - draggable vs. not draggable
    - removable vs. not removable
    - selectable vs. not selectable
    - turnable vs. not turnable
    - automatic behaviors such as movement and rotation


BUGS:
X switching modes while dragging causes placement bugs (not seeing anymore)
X some history tracking steps are being skipped (not seeing anymore)
- pure drag BUG: Without creating or destroying entities, there's an 
    occasional bug where a simple drag causes an entity's position to no 
    longer be tracked properly and ends up tracking the prior position. This 
    position dot is still left in the prior position while dragging and it 
    remains there after the drop. It seems to happen on a fast drag where 
    the position dot is not given enough time to be removed from the scene.
- rotation while dragging BUG: Rotating while dragging causes a history step to 
    be added where the entities rotated are deleted.


SYSTEM/CODE REFACTORS:
X better separation of entity space occupation from selection and drag-drop
- create central system for setting avail inventory items based on what's placed 
    on the inventory bar
- (maybe) PlayerInputManager has too much responsibility. Break it up.
- (maybe) move selected entity data management to GameEntityManager


LATER:
- game play/pause/restart system and controls:
    - play tick system
    - add some entity automated behaviors
    - entity automated behaviors are triggered at every tick
- save system
- add controls instructions


MAYBE:
