X setup environment:
    X 2D
    X top down
    X camera movement
    X camera zoom

X game menu:
    X restart
    X quit

X player controls:
    X item select
    X item placement
    X item drag
    X item rotation
    X item destruction
    X multi-select
    X multi-drag
    X multi-rotation
    X multi-destroy

X UI:
    X inventory:
        X drag from inventory
        X drag to inventory to destroy


REFINEMENTS:
X delete hot key
X make zoom zoom on mouse hover location
X make camera move on touch to edge of viewport
X clamp camera move to not be able to go farther than the board
X additive selection via additive hotkey
X fix entity->inventory sorting layers to be upon "dragging" state
X give entities a "drag" state, where they've not yet been moved and validation 
    can be performed
X drag and drop to inventory bar should cause a delete
X pending delete selection indicator color
X inventory hotkeys for quick inventory selection and placement
X inventory-hotkey mode should memorize last placement rotation
X inventory-hotkey mode should mass place on cursor while lmb is held
X make entity->cursor follow respect the discrete form of the mouse position
X make escape key function differently per context:
    X deselect if entities are selected
    X exit inventory-hotkey mode
X add telemetry ui for testing
X make screen edge camera move more forgiving
X undo/redo system, buttons, and hotkeys:
    X have HistoryStack keep track of "bottom" so that just like "top", you 
        cannot traverse past it
    X implement redo
    X BUG: rotations do not create history step
    X use own UUIDs for history tracking so that objects can be instantiated and 
        have them reassigned
    X account for dnd onto same positions (should not cause a history step)
X fix game entity management BUGS
X rename entity-hotkey mode to multi-place mode (and other renaming)
X add undo/redo history behavioral descriptions to MANUAL_TESTING doc
X add controls instructions
X refactor selection+drag:
    X decompose functions for setting and applying mouse->entity positional offsets
    X add to reset of offsets to entity group rotation
    X add a global mode for ui-debug (should override local debug settings)
    X add group drag container to the ui-debug mode
X make multi-select rotations rotate entities together instead of individually
X refactor multi-place to use drag-group
X copy+paste (single and multi):
    X selection of one or more entities is required to use mode
    X copy command should result in multi-placement mode
    X mode causes draggable multi-placement of the initial entities selected
    X the multi-place entities are rotatable
    X lmb-click causes placement
    X lmb held down causes continuous placement
    X placement is committed only if it is valid
    X escape press exits mode
X add inventory selection indicator to inventory bar
X fix bugs:
    X mode change to multiplace while dragging should cancel drag
    X esc press while dragging should cancel drag
X test various entity behaviors:
    X reduce interaction behavioral scripts to be only selectable and draggable 
    X automatic behaviors such as movement and rotation
    X push history step per automatic behavior action
X build tick system:
    X tick manager
    X event listeners
    X play/pause controls
    X fix bugs
X refactor tick to apply auto-behaviors to managed-entities directly instead of 
    through events (this will fix the history-step problem)
X more entities with behaviors:
    X wall
    X resource
    X behavioral (spawner, destroyer, duplicator, pusher, rotator, etc.)
X cleanup renderer ordering (broken upon game-entity selection)
X provide move and rotate interfaces for game-entities, migrate to using them
X collect mutations per game-entity per tick and then perform an application step
X make movement and rotation animated when entity actions are playing
X don't allow entity manipulation when scene is running (only entity selection)
X remove ffing of animations if it makes sense
X refactor entity position and rotation animations to allow for positions
    and rotations to always be descrete and for their SOTs to be the Unity
    transforms
X add rotation animations to player->entity manipulations
X better tick-playing indication
X BUGFIX: placement while rotating causes non discrete placements
X make data block on/off state dictated by rotation so that history steps work
    correctly with it
- create a tick-resolution system where multiple passes are made on all entities
    until it is determined that no more moves can be made.
- better inventory bar system:
    - Additional player-interactable game-entities should be simple and easy to
        add to the game.
    - Entity invetory bar icons should be generated at runtime if feasible
- save system
- another pass on telemetry
- another pass on controls instructions


BUGS:
    - (Potential) problems with action play and history controls, states are not
        correct


REFACTORS:
    - (MAYBE) refactor player inventory to have single source of truth
        (SOT should be owned by PlayerInventoryManager)
    - (MAYBE) convert constant groups to be enums


LATER:
- (maybe) make position conflict resolution randomized
- admin system for environment design:
    - toggleable
    - place & move normally unmovable entities
    - workflow for multi-scene creation
- more entities with behaviors:
    - (maybe) zone with effect (road, conveyor, etc.)
    - (maybe) zone without effect (decoration)
    - (maybe) modifiers (switch on wall, etc.)
