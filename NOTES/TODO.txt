X setup environment:
    X 2D
    X top down
    X camera movement
    X camera zoom

X game menu:
    X restart
    X quit

X player controls:
    X item select
    X item placement
    X item drag
    X item rotation
    X item destruction
    X multi-select
    X multi-drag
    X multi-rotation
    X multi-destroy

X UI:
    X inventory:
        X drag from inventory
        X drag to inventory to destroy


REFINEMENTS:
X delete hot key
X make zoom zoom on mouse hover location
X make camera move on touch to edge of viewport
X clamp camera move to not be able to go farther than the board
X additive selection via additive hotkey
X fix entity->inventory sorting layers to be upon "dragging" state
X give entities a "drag" state, where they've not yet been moved and validation can be performed
X drag and drop to inventory bar should cause a delete
X pending delete selection indicator color
X inventory hotkeys for quick inventory selection and placement
X inventory-hotkey mode should memorize last placement rotation
- inventory-hotkey mode should mass place on cursor while lmb is held
- undo/redo system, buttons, and hotkeys


BUGS:
- inventory-hotkey mode can sometimes result in bugged illegal move detection
- entering menu mode while in inventory-hotkey mode should not cause entity placement


REFACTORS:
- move selected entity data management to GameEntityManager


THINGS TO CONSIDER:
- hot key for entity placement will introduce drag without click press


LATER:
- game play/pause/restart system and controls
- add controls instructions


MAYBE:
