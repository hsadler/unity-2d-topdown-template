TODO:

X setup environment:
    X 2D
    X top down
    X camera movement
    X camera zoom

X game menu:
    X restart
    X quit

X player controls:
    X item select
    X item placement
    X item drag
    X item rotation
    X item destruction
    X multi-select
    X multi-drag
    X multi-rotation
    X multi-destroy

X UI:
    X inventory:
        X drag from inventory
        X drag to inventory to destroy


REFINEMENTS:
X delete hot key
X make zoom zoom on mouse hover location
X make camera move on touch to edge of viewport
X clamp camera move to not be able to go farther than the board
X additive selection via additive hotkey
X fix entity->inventory sorting layers to be upon "dragging" state
X give entities a "drag" state, where they've not yet been moved and validation 
    can be performed
X drag and drop to inventory bar should cause a delete
X pending delete selection indicator color
X inventory hotkeys for quick inventory selection and placement
X inventory-hotkey mode should memorize last placement rotation
X inventory-hotkey mode should mass place on cursor while lmb is held
X make entity->cursor follow respect the discrete form of the mouse position
X make escape key function differently per context:
    X deselect if entities are selected
    X exit inventory-hotkey mode
X add telemetry ui for testing
X make screen edge camera move more forgiving
- undo/redo system, buttons, and hotkeys:
    X have HistoryStack keep track of "bottom" so that just like "top", you 
        cannot traverse past it
    X implement redo
    X BUG: rotations do not create history step
    X use own UUIDs for history tracking so that objects can be instantiated and 
        have them reassigned
    - account for dnd onto same positions (should not cause a history step)
- make multi-select rotations rotate entities together instead of individually


BUGS:
X multiple placement bug when in inventory hotkey mode
- switching modes while dragging causes placement bugs


SYSTEM/CODE REFACTORS:
X better separation of entity space occupation from selection and drag-drop
- (maybe) PlayerInputManager has too much responsibility. Break it up.
- (maybe) move selected entity data management to GameEntityManager


LATER:
- game play/pause/restart system and controls
- add controls instructions


MAYBE:
